i change the value of slope and offset for the air pressure sensor to calibrate it with more higher accuracy air pressure that already attached to the air tank body, showing the same value and increasing the value accuracy digit from 2 to 3

*nb air pressure sensor position are affecting the value so need to re-calibrate it again after getting reinstall
